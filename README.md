# IndianaBones
An R package for the virtual analysis of bone 3D morphology.

The package implements some novel tools for the study of bone morphology using micro-Computerized Tomography (microCT). Currently, it includes a set of functions for the segmentation of cancellous and compact bone, and for the characterization of the cancellous architecture. Other functions allow handling and processing 3D image stacks (volumes).

'indianaBones' is intended for use in the fields of Archaeology, Palaeontology, Osteology, Physical Anthropology and Biomedicine. New tools will be added soon.
